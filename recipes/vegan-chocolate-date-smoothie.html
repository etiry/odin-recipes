	<h2>Description</h2>

	By Kelli Foster, from <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-vegan-chocolate-date-smoothie-242817">The Kitchn</a>

	<p>You’re an adult, so of course you can have chocolate for breakfast when you feel like it. But this is different because this is how to have chocolate for breakfast without it being a piece of cake. Every sip of this creamy smoothie — made with dates, bananas, and almond butter — tastes rich and satisfying, and you can count on its wholesome and nourishing ingredients to fill you up. -Kelli Foster</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>2 cups unsweetened nut milk</li>
		<li>4 dried dates, pitted</li>
		<li>2 medium frozen bananas</li>

		<li>2 tablespoons almond butter</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
	</ul>
